# ToDo:

## Think of building a similar page (not the exact same one) that can be used for a person who is starting a small business on selling “baked goods”.

- Start working towards the goals:
  - Split responsibilities and set up meetings beyond the class time
  - Prepare a plan to complete the task

### Design the page and deploy [by 02/05/2026, 11:59 PM]

### Submission

    - the github link (should have at least 5 commits)
    - live link (netlify or any other platform)

### Present (2 minute) the work [next class, at the beginning]
